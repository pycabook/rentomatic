# Rentomatic

A demo implementation of a clean architecture in Python.

The goal of the "Rent-o-Matic" project is to create a simple search engine for a room renting company. Objects in the dataset (rooms) are described by some attributes and the search engine shall allow the user to set some filters to narrow the search. The system exposes a REST API and works with three types of storage system: in-memory database, Postgres, MongoDB.

This is a companion repository for the book "Clean Architectures in Python" by Leonardo Giordani, published by Leanpub.

You can download the book [here](https://leanpub.com/clean-architectures-in-python).

The repository contains the **code for the second edition** of the book. If for some reasons you are still following the first edition you can find the code in the branch `first-edition`. The tags mentioned in the first edition still exists in that branch.
